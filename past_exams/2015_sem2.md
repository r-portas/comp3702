# COMP3702 Final Exam, Sem 2 2015

## Q1

### a) What search algorithm is MysterySearch?

Looking at the algorithm:

- Uses priority queue (Not BFS or DFS)
- It does not use a heurtistic, thus must be Uniform Cost Search

### b) Is the algorithm complete?

The algorithm is uniform costs, as long as the cost function is greater than 0 then it is complete

### c) Is the algorithm optimal

Yes, as long as the epsilon value is greater than 0

### d) If there is no path between the start and end, will the algorithm halt?

The algorithm does not revisit nodes, as the `E` set holds the set of nodes, which ensures a node is not visited twice.

## Q2

"Liars always speak what is false, and truth-tellers always speak what is true. Suppose Amy, Bob, and Cal are each either a liar or truth-teller. Amy says, Bob is a liar. Bob says, Cal is a liar. Cal says, Amy and Bob are liars."

### a) Define the problem as propositional logic

```
A: Amy is a truth teller
B: Bob is a truth teller
C: Cal is a truth teller

A <--> ~B
B <--> ~C
C <--> ~A ^ ~B
```

### b) Prove answer with resolution refutation

- Convert to CNF
- Start by negating the question
- Try to find a contradiction

```
Negation of conclusion: C

Convert to AND and OR
A <--> ~B 	= (A -> ~B) ^ (~B -> A)
			= (~A v ~B) ^ (B v A)
			
B <--> ~C 	= (B -> ~C) ^ (~C -> B)
			= (~B v ~C) ^ (C v B)

C <--> (~A ^ ~B) 	= (C -> (~A ^ ~B)) ^ ((~A ^ ~B) -> C)
					= (~C v (~A ^ ~B)) ^ (~(~A ^ ~B) v C)
					= (~C v ~A) ^ (~C v ~B) ^ (A v B v C)

1) ~A v ~B
2) B v A
3) ~B v ~C
4) C v B
5) ~C v ~A
6) ~C v ~B
7) A v B v C
8) C

(8) & (5): ~A (9)
(9) & (2): B (10)
(10) & (3): ~C (11)
(11) & (8): F (Contradiction)
```

Therefore we have shown that Cal is a liar. (~C is True) using resolution refutation

## Q3

### a) Write down the sequence of edges visited

- Review __Minimax__

```
e1 - e4 - e10 - e9 - e3 - e8 - e2 - e6 - e13 - e14
```



### b)

## Q4: _Might be on Exam_

Construct a function that maps the amount of minutes the users save by travelling through the toll to the maximum cost that BrisToll can set, so that the users are still attracted to use the toll road. Use Maximum Expected Utility to explain your answer.

__No Toll__

|                        | Profit | %    |
| ---------------------- | ------ | ---- |
| On Time                | 400    | 40   |
| 1 - 60 minutes late    | 300    | 30   |
| 61 - 120 minutes late  | 200    | 20   |
| 121 - 180 minutes late | 100    | 10   |

__Toll__

| Time Saved    | Max Price |
| ------------- | --------- |
| t1: 0 - 60    | c1        |
| t2: 61 - 120  | c2        |
| t3: 121 - 180 | c3        |



```
f(t1) so that E[Profit - lost from toll] > E[Profit with no toll]

E[Profit with no toll] 	= 0.4 * 400 + 0.3 * 300 + 0.2 * 200 + 0.1 * 100
						= 300
```

__Toll with saving of 0 - 60m (t1)__ 

|                 | % (t = time saved)               |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| On Time         | 40 + (t/60) * 30                 |
| 1 - 60m late    | (30 - (t/60) * 30) + (t/60) * 20 |
| 61 - 120m late  | (20 - (t/60) * 20) + (t/60) * 10 |
| 121 - 180m late | (10 - (t/60) * 10)               |

```
E[Profit - cost] = (40 + 1/2 * t) * (400 - c1) + (30 - 1/2 * t + 1/3 * t) * (300 - c1) + (20 - 1/3 * t  + 1/6 * t) * (200 - c1) + (10 - 1/6 * t) * (100 - c1)
```

__Toll with saving of 61 - 120m (t2)__ 

|                 | % (t = time saved)                       |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| On Time         | 40 + 30 + ((t - 60)/60) * 20             |
| 1 - 60m late    | (20 - ((t - 60)/60) * 20) + ((t - 60) /60) * 10 |
| 61 - 120m late  | 10 - ((t - 60)/60)                       |
| 121 - 180m late | 0                                        |

```
E[Profit - cost] = (40 + 30 + ((t - 60)/60) * 20) * (400 - c2) + ((20 - ((t - 60)/60) * 20) + ((t - 60) /60) * 10) * (300 - c2) + (10 - ((t - 60)/60)) * (200 - c2)
```



## Q5

### a) Explain the relation between the Y update equation and Bellman update equation

This equation looks two steps ahead, as it has a nested function

### b) Is it faster in respect to the computation time

No, it should be slower since it is looking two steps ahead at every calculation

### c) Is it faster in respect to the number of iterations

No, since it will be doing the same number of iterations, it is just looking an extra step ahead at every iteration.
