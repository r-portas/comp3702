# COMP3702 Final Exam, Sem 2 2014

## Q1

### a) Convert each sentence to CNF
```
~(P ^ ~Q) v ~(~S ^ ~T)  = ((~P v Q) v (S v T))
                        = ~P v Q v S v T

~(T v Q)                = ~T ^ ~Q

U -> (~T -> (~S ^ P))   = U -> (~(~S ^ P) -> T)
                        = U -> ((S v ~P) -> T)
                        = U -> (~(S v ~P) v T)
                        = U -> (~S ^ P v T)
                        = ~U v (~S ^ P v T)
                        = (~U v ~S) ^ (~U v P v T)

1) ~P v Q v S v T
2) ~T
3) ~Q
4) ~U v ~S
5) ~U v P v T
```

### b) Use resolution of refutation to prove `~U`
```
Using the resolution rule

(2) + (5) = ~U v P (6)
(6) + (1) = ~U v Q v S v T (7)
(7) + (2) = ~U v Q v S (8)
(8) + (3) = ~U v S (9)
(9) + (4) = ~U v ~U
```

## Q2

```
Car Cost: $1000
Car Profit: $1100

P(good) = 0.8
good repair = $40

P(bad) = 0.2
bad repair = $120

inspection cost = $10
inspection accuracy = 0.8

car insurance = $60
```

No car inspection or insurance:

```
profit for good: $60
profit for bad: -$20

Expected Utility: 60 * 0.8 + 0.2 * -20
                    = $44
```

Inspection, no insurance
```
good car, pass inspection: 0.8 * 0.8: 0.64
good car, fail inspection: 0.8 * 0.2: 0.16

bad car, fail inspection: 0.2 * 0.8: 0.16
bad car, pass inspection: 0.2 * 0.2: 0.04

only buy car if it is good and passes inspection:
profit  = 0.64 * 50 + 0.04 * -30
        = 32 - 1.2
        = $30.8
```

Car Insurance
```
Car insurance effectively repairs any vehicle for $60
Profit after insurance: $40
```

Thus the most profit will be made from using __neither__ insurance or inspections.

## Q3

### a) Model the problem as a MDP

```
S = ((r, b) E {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10})
A = {Stay, MoveForward, MoveForwardTwo}
T = 
    if r = b: T(startPos, action, endPos)
        0.7 chance of ball moving one (b + 1)
        0.3 chance of ball moving two (b + 2)
    if r != b: 1, b = b (ball will not move)
R = +10 for goal, -1 otherwise
D = Discount factor, 0.95
```

### b)

```
V6  = -1 + 0.95 * (0.7 * 10 + 0.3 * -1)
    = 5.365

V5  = -1 + 0.95 * (0.7 * -1 + 0.3 * 10)
    = 1.185
```

## Q4
