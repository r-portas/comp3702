# Week 4 Tutorial

## Q1)

### a)

A valid configuration space will be `C = {(x, y): 0 < x < W, 0 < y < H}`

### b)

The forbidden regions will be the area inside the obstacles, as these are invalid for the robot to move in. Furthermore, due to the size of the robot, the forbidden region will expand outside the area of the obstacles to ensure that no part of the robot can hit the obstacle.

## Q2)

### a)

A valid configuration space will be `C = {(a): 0 < a < 360}`

### b)

Since the robot collides for angles between 45 and 135. The forbidden region will be the arange between 45 and 135.
